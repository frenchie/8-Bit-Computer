# An 8-bit Computer

My take on breadboard computer designs from [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/8bit) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS0N5baNlQWJCUrhCEo8WlA)) and [James Bates](https://github.com/jamesbates/jcpu) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH09NwwJsfThwLKvc6kxl4Q)).

## A Note For People Looking At This - Here Be Monsters!

This design has had most (but not all) of its components tested. My boards are currently on order but have not yet arrived. Please take all schematics as prototype. They may or may not work, or may not work as intended.

PCB design files have been deliberately omitted until tested. I will update this repository with the complete design files once I'm happy it works.

You've been warned!
